    "In this exercise we study decision making in a network of competing populations of spiking neurons. The network has been proposed by Wong and Wang in 2006 [1] as a model of decision making in a visual motion detection task. The decision making task and the network are described in the [book](http://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/Ch16.html) and in the original publication (see [References](#location-references) [1]).\n",
